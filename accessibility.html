      <h1>Accessibility Statement</h1>

      <p>
        Tesla Motors Ltd. ("Tesla") is committed to making its website accessible to everyone, including people with
        disabilities. To this end, Tesla works and invests many resources on an ongoing basis to improve the
        accessibility
        of
        its website and its content, in order to ensure equal access to all surfers the site.
        The website has been adjusted according to the regulations on equal rights for people with disabilities
        (accessibility
        adjustments to the service), the recommendations of the Israeli standard (TI 5568) and the W3C's Web Content
        Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 standard.
      </p>


      <h2>Accessibility fixes and adjustments</h2>

      <p>
        Tesla's goal is to support a wide variety of web browsers and assistive technologies. Therefore, efforts have
        been
        made
        to support software with a wide market share, including Windows, IOS, and Android and the prominent web browsers
        such as
        Chrome and Explorer. Web content technologies we have used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JPG, SVG, PNG, PDF, MP4. In
        addition,
        below are the adjustments made as part of the site's accessibility and the options available in it:
      </p>

      <ul>

        <li>
          The site has text alternatives for any non-text content, such as images or icons.</li>

        <li>
          Information, structure and relationships conveyed through a presentation can be recognized by assistive
          software.
        </li>

        <li>
          Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, and contrast-ratio has been improved for
          visually
          impaired users.
        </li>

        <li>
          You can navigate the content provided on the site using keys and keyboard shortcuts.
        </li>

        <li>
          The content provided on the site has headings that describe a topic or purpose, and a user can bypass
          repetitive blocks
          on the pages of the site.
        </li>

        <li>
          The default human language of the content on the site can be detected by software.
        </li>

        <li>
          Enabling ARIA features, unique homepage identifiers on investor relations websites and product websites.
        </li>

        <li>
          You can navigate with the keyboard by choosing a color and wheels in interactive "carousel" elements on the
          site.
        </li>

      </ul>




      <h2>Contact</h2>
      <p>
        Despite our efforts to make the site accessible to people with disabilities, it is possible that certain pages
        on the
        site have not yet been accessed, including for the reason that an adequate technological solution for
        accessibility has
        not been found, and it is also possible that certain pages on the site may contain human errors due to a variety
        of
        reasons. We are committed to continuing to improve the accessibility of our sites. For inquiries and questions
        about
        accessibility, you can contact the accessibility coordinator, Nitai Gilboa at ngilboa@tesla.com or at
        03-3751760.
